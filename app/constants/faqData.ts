  },
  {
    question: "2. How will we talk to each other?",
    answer:
      ["After we start working together, we'll talk directly. If I design the ideas and the look, you'll also talk to our visualizer in a group chat. Talking clearly and quickly helps us make better thumbnails."],

    question: "4. How many times can I ask for changes?",

    answer:
      [
        "- A/B testing means making 2 or 3 slightly different thumbnails to see which one works best.",
        "- If we change small things like text or pictures, that's A/B testing.",

    question: "6. How do you make thumbnails and titles?",
    answer: [
      "We have people who plan and design each thumbnail and title. We make sure they match your videos, your brand, and what your viewers like. We want to make thumbnails that people click on."

    question: "7. Can you make new thumbnails for old videos?",
    answer:
      ["Yes! We can make new thumbnails for older videos to get more people to watch them. We'll use A/B testing to see if the new thumbnail is better."],

  {
    question: "8. How long does it take to get a thumbnail?",
    answer:
      ["We usually send you the thumbnail within 48 hours (2 days, not including weekends) after you give us the video details. If you need changes, we'll talk quickly to get it done."],

  {
    question: "9. Do you do A/B testing to make thumbnails better?",
    answer:
      ["Yes! We do A/B testing for new and old videos to make sure the thumbnails work as well as possible."],

    question: "10. How much do I need to do?",
    answer:
