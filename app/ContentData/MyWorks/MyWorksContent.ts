✅ *GUIDE FOR NON-CODERS: MANAGING CLIENT WORK IMAGES* 🎉
--------------------------------
🖼️ *Where to Store Images:*  
   - All images should be placed in the `/public/MyWorksImages/` folder.

📌 *Naming & Format:*  
   - Ensure that the image file names exactly match the names listed in the `clientsWorkImages` array.  
   - Keep file extensions consistent (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`).  

➕ *Adding New Images:*  
   - You can add as many images as you want!  
   - Just upload them to `/public/MyWorksImages/` and add their file names to the array below, separating them with commas.

🗑️ *Removing Images:*  
   - If you want to remove an image, delete its entry from the array and remove the file from the folder.

🚀 *Your changes will automatically update across the website!*
