====================================================================

This file contains text content for the Strategy section of your application.
You can easily customize the text by replacing the values assigned to each 
exported variable below.

1️⃣. Each variable holds a string that represents a specific part of the strategy 
    section (e.g., top description, step one text, bottom title, etc.).
2️⃣. Update the text between the quotation marks ("") to match your desired content.
3️⃣. Keep the structure intact, and avoid changing the variable names.
4️⃣. Follow the comments for guidance on what each text section represents.

Happy customizing!
