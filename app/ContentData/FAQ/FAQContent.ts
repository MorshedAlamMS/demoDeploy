export const answer1 = "Just email me about your videos or projects. Tell me when you post videos and how many thumbnails you need each month.";

export const answer2 = "After we start working together, we'll talk directly. If I design the ideas and the look, you'll also talk to our visualizer in a group chat. Talking clearly and quickly helps us make better thumbnails.";

// If you want to show as like tamplate design, use this format for the message:

    `Send me these things in a list so it's easy to understand:
- A 'Video Title'
- What the video is about (a short summary)
- Pictures or other things to use in the thumbnail
- Words you need on the thumbnail
- Examples of thumbnails you like (if you have any)
- Anything else you want to tell me
- 'Channel link' (if you have one)

// If you want to show as like tamplate design, use this format for the message:
export const answer5 =
    `- A/B testing means making 2 or 3 slightly different thumbnails to see which one works best.
- If we change small things like text or pictures, that's A/B testing.
- If we make big changes, that's a new thumbnail.`;

export const answer6 = "We have people who plan and design each thumbnail and title. We make sure they match your videos, your brand, and what your viewers like. We want to make thumbnails that people click on.";

export const answer7 = "Yes! We can make new thumbnails for older videos to get more people to watch them. We'll use A/B testing to see if the new thumbnail is better.";

export const answer8 = "We usually send you the thumbnail within 48 hours (2 days, not including weekends) after you give us the video details. If you need changes, we'll talk quickly to get it done.";

export const answer9 = "Yes! We do A/B testing for new and old videos to make sure the thumbnails work as well as possible.";

export const answer10 = "We do everything for you. We'll make the thumbnails and give you advice when you need it. You don't have to do much.";
